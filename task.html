    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
         <cite><a href = "https://www.lipsum.com/"> Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s</a></cite>, 
         when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
         It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, 
         remaining essentially unchanged.</p>
    <p>It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, 
        remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of <q>Letraset 
        sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like 
        Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</q></p>
